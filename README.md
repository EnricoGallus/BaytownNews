# Development Process

## Importmaps

Using importmaps and added bootstrap to it

## Rubocop - Securing a coding style

1. Added rubocop-gem.
2. Executed ``bundle exec rubocop -a`` as well as ``bundle exec rubocop --autocorrect-all``
3. Executed ``bundle exec rubocop --auto-gen-config`` which generated `.rubocop.yml` and `.rubocop_todo.yml`

Use `.rubocop_todo.yml` for ignoring violations temporarily and `.rubocop.yml` for general overwrites or custom definitions
